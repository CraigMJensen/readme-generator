## Description 

  * This application will generate a quality README file for your projects. Making a README.md has never been easier! Answer a few questions and fill out some information, then a professional README will be generated in the generated folder.

## Installation

  * Download the code from my repository on your local machine. If you do NOT have Node.js installed on your machine, download that now. Open your command line or terminal and run 'npm install'. The application should be ready for use.



## Usage

  * In the command line run 'node index' or 'node index.js'. Follow the prompts and fill out all the information you would like to contain in your README.md file. Once all the questions have been answered, your new README.md will be waiting for you in the 'generated' folder. Copy and paste your new README to the file location you desire. You can then add any images, gifs or anything else you like to spice up the page!
